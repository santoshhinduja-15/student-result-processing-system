# Student Result Processing System
A core Python-based command-line application to manage and process student examination results. The system supports multiple students, validates unique roll numbers, calculates total marks and percentages, assigns grades, stores data persistently using file handling, and allows searching results by roll number.

## Features
- Add multiple student records
- Unique roll number validation
- Automatic calculation of total marks and percentage
- Grade assignment (A, B, C, Fail)
- Persistent data storage using file handling
- View all student results
- Search student result by roll number
- Input validation for marks and numeric values
- Modular and structured codebase

## Tech Stack
- Python (Core Python only)
- File handling for data persistence
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/santoshhinduja-15/student-result-processing-system.git 
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd student-result-processing-system
3. Run the application: python main.py

## Grading Criteria
- Percentage ≥ 75 → Grade A  
- Percentage ≥ 60 → Grade B  
- Percentage ≥ 40 → Grade C  
- Percentage < 40 → Fail  

## Limitations
- No GUI or web interface
- No database (file-based storage only)
- No update or delete student functionality
These limitations are intentional to keep the project focused on core Python concepts.

## Future Enhancements
- Update and delete student records
- Sorting results (topper, lowest score)
- CSV-based structured storage
- Improved search and reporting features
